## The Company

  Founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, Bellabeat is a wellness tech company creating beautifully designed smart products for women. The company tracks activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with insights into their well-being. By 2016, Bellabeat expanded globally, selling products through online retailers and its own e-commerce platform. The company focuses on digital marketing, including Google Search, social media, YouTube ads, and the Google Display Network, alongside traditional advertising. For more details you can check the website here [BellaBeat](<https://bellabeat.com/>)

## 1. Ask Phase

####  Questions

  * We want to find out how the customers are using the BellaBeat devices trought out their day, like Leaf for example
  * By analysing the data from the devices will we discover some trends or patterns that could lead to insihgts.

### Business Task

*How do women use Leaf throughout their daily routines and how does it impact their health and wellness?*

### Setting up my environment
  Setting up my environment by loading some packages

```{r loading packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
```
## 2. Prepare Phase

#### Importing DataSets
  
  For this case study I will use the FitBit Fitness Tracker [DataSet](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit>)
```{r importing datasets}
activity <- read.csv("Bellabeat/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
calories <- read.csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
intensities <- read.csv("Bellabeat/dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
steps <- read.csv("Bellabeat/dailySteps_merged.csv")
sleep <- read.csv("Bellabeat/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read.csv("Bellabeat/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```

  * **Data Storage**
    + We get access to the data by the *FitBit Fitness Tracker Data* DataSet, available on Kaggle.
    + The data is storage in csv format, being easy and pratical to work with. They are in long format
  * **Bias and Credibility** 
    + The dataset has a *sample bias* because it includes data from only 30 participants, wich is not representative of the entire population, it fails capturing the diversity of the population;
    + We can follow the ROCCC protocol to check the credibility of the dataset:
      + **Representatives**: We have a limitation because it only contains 30 participants;
      + **Objectivity**: The collection relied on wearable devices, wich likely reduce self-reporting errors.But in the other hand differences in FitBit tracker models and user behaviors may influence the data;
      + **Completeness**: The dataset provides detailed information about physical activity , heart rate and sleep;
      + **Consistency**: It uses timestamps and session IDs that allows clear data parsing;
      + **Currency**: The dataset is outdated, having 8 years, wich may not represent the current population;

## 3. Process Phase

### Cleanning and Summary

  I have checked the duplicates through the dataset, only finding in the daile_sleep data.
```{r removing duplicates}
print(sum(duplicated(activity)))
print(sum(duplicated(calories)))
print(sum(duplicated(intensities)))
print(sum(duplicated(steps)))
print(sum(duplicated(sleep)))
print(sum(duplicated(weight)))

sleep_new <- sleep %>% distinct()

```
  Summarizing the data to get to know about the dataset.
```{r}
#Atividade
activity %>% 
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         Calories,
         SedentaryMinutes) %>% 
  summary()

#Calorias gastas
calories %>% 
  select(Calories) %>% 
  summary()

#Sono
sleep_new %>% 
  select(TotalSleepRecords,
         TotalTimeInBed,
         TotalMinutesAsleep) %>% 
  summary()
 
#Peso
weight_new %>% 
  select(WeightKg,
         Fat,
         BMI,
         height) %>% 
  summary()
  
```
  
### Interesting Observations

  + The WHO, World Health Organization, recommends that each person engages in physical activity, like 10,000 steps per day. In this study, participants have an average of 7,638 steps per day;
  + In the Sleep summary we can see that on average, participants spend 7 hours and 38 minutos in bed, but only 6 of are actually spent sleeping;
  + In average the participants spend 1 hour and 39 minutes of their day sedentary.

## 4. Analysis Phase

### Merging data

```{r merging the data}
calories_weight <- full_join(calories,weight_new,by = "Id")
head(calories_weight)
```
### Visualization
  
  
  First we will compare the **Steps** with the **Sedentary Time** to see if we have some relation between them.
  

```{r visualization Steps x Sedentary Time}

correlation_steps_sedentary <- cor(activity$TotalSteps, activity$SedentaryMinutes)


ggplot(activity,aes( x= TotalSteps, y = SedentaryMinutes)) + 
  geom_point(color = "lightblue",size = 3, alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkblue", size = 1.2, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Relation between Total Steps and Sedentary Time",
       x = "Total Steps",
       y = "Sedentary Time (Minutes)") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)
  ) +
  annotate("text", 
         x = max(activity$TotalSteps) * 0.7,  # Adjust the position of the text
         y = max(activity$SedentaryMinutes) * 0.9,  # Adjust the position of the text
         label = paste("r =", round(correlation_steps_sedentary, 2)),  # Add correlation coefficient
         size = 5, color = "black", fontface = "bold")  # Text formatting

```

 + We can see that as the total number of steps increases, the time spent being sedentary tends to decrease
 + There is a variability in sedentary time for those with low step counts;
 + But higher step counts show less variation, as they consistently exhibit lower sedentary minutes;
 

  Next we can compare the **Total of Steps** with the **Calories Burned**

```{r visualization Steps x Calories Burned}

correlation_steps_calorias <- cor(activity$TotalSteps, activity$Calories)

ggplot(activity, aes(x= TotalSteps, y = Calories)) +
  geom_point(color = "lightblue", size = 3, alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkblue", size = 1.2, linetype = "dashed") + 
  labs(title = "Relation between Total Steps and Calories Burned",
       x = "Total Steps",
       y = "Calories Burned") + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)
  ) +
  annotate("text",
           x = max(activity$TotalSteps) * 0.75,  # Adjust the position of the text
           y = max(activity$SedentaryMinutes) * 0.8,  # Adjust the position of the text
           label = paste("r =", round(correlation_steps_calorias, 2)),  # Add correlation coefficient
           size = 5, color = "black", fontface = "bold")  # Text formatting


```

  + We can see that as the total number of steps increases, the calories burned tends to increase to;
  + The range extends from 0 to approximately 30,000 steps, showing diversity in the participant activity levels;
  
  Now we will see the **Distribution off Sleep Efficiency**

```{r Distribution of Sleep Efficiency}
sleep_new <- sleep_new %>% 
  mutate(efficiency = sleep_new$TotalMinutesAsleep / sleep_new$TotalTimeInBed * 100)

# Calculate binwidth dynamically
bin_width <- 2 * IQR(sleep_new$efficiency, na.rm = TRUE) / length(sleep_new$efficiency)^(1/3)

# Calculate efficiency
sleep_new <- sleep_new %>%
  mutate(efficiency = (TotalMinutesAsleep / TotalTimeInBed) * 100)

# Create the histogram
ggplot(sleep_new, aes(x = efficiency)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = bin_width,
    fill = "#0073C2", 
    color = "black",
    alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    aes(xintercept = mean(efficiency, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text", x = mean(sleep_new$efficiency, na.rm = TRUE) + 5, y = Inf,
    label = "Mean", vjust = 1, color = "red", fontface = "italic"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Sleep Efficiency",
    subtitle = "Efficiency based on total sleep time relative to time in bed",
    x = "Sleep Efficiency (%)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "gray40"),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)))

```
  + Most participants are getting good quality sleep, as indicated by the high concentration near 90-100% range;


  Lastly we will check the **Sleep Efficiency across Sleep Records**

```{r}
mean_sleep_efficiency <- mean(sleep_new$efficiency)
print(mean_sleep_efficiency)


mean_sleep_records <- sleep_new %>% 
  filter(TotalSleepRecords == 3) %>% 
  summarize(mean_efficiency = mean(efficiency, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(mean_efficiency)

print(mean_sleep_records)

ggplot(sleep_new, aes(
  x = as.factor(TotalSleepRecords), 
  y = efficiency, 
  group = as.factor(TotalSleepRecords), 
  color = as.factor(TotalSleepRecords)
)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) + # Add jitter for better visualization of overlapping points
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") + # Add boxplot for summary statistics
  labs(
    title = "Sleep Efficiency Across Sleep Records",
    subtitle = "Analysis of sleep efficiency grouped by total sleep records",
    x = "Number of Sleep Records",
    y = "Sleep Efficiency (%)",
    color = "Sleep Records"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "gray40"),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") + # Use a clear and distinct color palette
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) # Add breathing room above 
```

  + As the number of sleep records increases, the variability in sleep efficiency tends to decrease, especially in individuals with 3 Sleep Records
